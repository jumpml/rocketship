A C and Python inference library for speech and audio. 

## Introduction
C and Python code for

  - [x] Linear, GRU layers with 8-bit weights and biases
  - [x] Float32 and fixed-point 16-bit activations
  - [x] Converts PyTorch model file (pth) to C 
  - [ ] More NN Layers support coming : LSTM, LayerNorm, Conv1D, ...
- DSP Pre/postprocessing
  - [x] STFT / ISTFT based on the awesome kissFFT library
  - [x] Log Power Spectrum, Spectral Masking and Gain post-processing
  - [ ] Log Mel filterbank

  - [ ] Speech-to-Text
  - [ ] Small Language Model

Intended for applications at the Edge, typically battery-powered, where Privacy, Availability/Reliability, Low Cost (Energy or Fees), Real-Time and very Low Latency are critical.

## Plans 
Plans are always subject to change
- [ ] Documentation & Tutorials
- [ ] Release models for other speech/audio ML tasks
- [ ] Tools for training and customization

### Model class categorization based on size
Based on the number of model parameters, we use the following (totally arbitrary) model categorization convention

| Model Category | Model Size        | Chips/MCU Type            |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Mini           | < 256 kB          | MCU, DSP                  |
| Midi           | 256 kB to < 1 MB  | Premium MCU/DSP           |
| Pro            | 1 MB to < 4 MB    | Accelerator, Mobile CPU   |
| Pro+           | > 4 MB            | Mobile/Laptop CPU/GPU     |

Larger models usually result in improved task performance and quality.

## Getting Started

To get started with JumpML Rocketship, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jumpml/rocketship.git
   cd rocketship
   ```

2. Please create a Python virtual environment and install the packages in requirements.txt:
   ```bash
   pip install requirements.txt
   ```

3. Build the library using the provided makefile:
    ```bash
    make
    ```
4. Run JumpML NR Inference/Prediction script (Pytorch + Librosa/Numpy)
To run the reference algorithm (preprocessing + NN inference + postprocessing) on an input wav file, please run
```bash
python models/run_prediction.py -m models/pretrained_models/jumpmlnr_pro.ptj -i data/outdoor_mix.wav -o data/output.wav
```

## JumpML NR 
The JumpML NR block diagram is as follows

Input Frame (Hop Length) --> STFT (FFT size) --> log-Magnitude (IO size) --> NN Masker --> ISTFT(FFT size) --> Denoised Output (Hop Length)

### Processing steps  
1. The 16 kHz input signal is framed into Hop Length samples
2. A hanning windowed FFT with 50% overlap is performed 
3. Log Magnitude (Power) features are computed ignoring the Nyquist bin for a total of IO size == Hop Length
4. These IO size features are input to the Neural network and predicts a IO size point mask that multiplies the noisy input spectrum
5. Inverse STFT (Overlap Add) is performed to produce the denoised and speech enhanced output frame

### Denoise Audio Wavefile on MacOS
####  denoise.sh
The denoise.sh script(in the "scripts" directory) calls the testnr executable (in the "build" directory after running "make") which is compiled for MacOS and performs processing at 16 kHz. 

We recommend using denoise.sh to apply JumpML NR on a noisy input file. The shell script takes care of any resampling and file format conversions.

**Usage:**

```bash
scripts/denoise.sh input.wav output.wav naturalness min_gain
```

**Arguments:**

* `input.wav`: input WAV file.
* `output.wav`:  output WAV file.
* `naturalness`: float number between 0 (max suppression) and 1 (most natural). 
* `min_gain`: minimum suppression gain floor in dB in [-60, 0] dB.

**Example tunings to try:**  

Tuning is usually a matter of preference and use case. Any of the below example commands are pretty good starting points:

```bash
scripts/denoise.sh data/outdoor_mix.wav output_nat100_mg40.wav 1 -40  
scripts/denoise.sh data/outdoor_mix.wav output_nat50_mg25.wav 0.5 -25
scripts/denoise.sh data/outdoor_mix.wav output_nat0_mg10.wav 0 -10
```

#### Pre-requisites
Please install SoX 
```bash
brew install sox
```
**Settings in MacOS:**
```bash
chmod +x testnr 
chmod +x denoise.sh
```

Even after this, there may be a popup that says App cannot be run. Please follow the instructions in [this Apple Support article](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491) under
